Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum. Student leaders work alongside IBM to design and plan their event, which are run in October and November. Each event is standalone - only made for the students on that particular campus.<br><br>The Qiskit Fall Fest at SDSU will platform guest speakers, and feature three interactive labs created by IBM Quantum. It is an opportunity to network, learn about quantum technology, information, and science. Members will also be able to earn a certificate issued by IBM Quantum.
