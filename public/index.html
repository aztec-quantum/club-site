                        If you finish all 10 functions, there will be an open ended portion to submit a quantum algorithm implementation of your choice, with a writeup summarizing the algorithm and its applications. To determine a winner, submissions will be evaluated based on their effectiveness and creativeness.
                        Collaboration is encouraged! Submissions can be individual or group, and only 1 group member needs to register. Groups may be as large as 6 members. Spread the word, tell your friends, and good luck!
                        For San Diego locals, the club will be meeting on campus the evening of Wednesday April 24th to kick off the challenge.
